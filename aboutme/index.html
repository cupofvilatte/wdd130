            <p>
                Hi, my name is Vilate, but you can call me ViLatte. I'm studying software engineering with a minor in English. I love the aspect of programming that lets you do anything as long as you use the right logic. I love poetry. Some of my favourite poets are Thomas Hardy, Ted Kooser, and Langston Hughes.

                I want to someday live in Poland. At an earlier point in life I wanted to work in Poland, but my career path gives me the option of working remotely, which is a blessing and an advantage of working in the world today. I'm excited to keep learning and aquiring skills and to enter the industry.
